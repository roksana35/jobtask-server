# SmartWive

Smatwive is a full-stack web application designed to provide users with a seamless and intelligent product browsing experience. It features a comprehensive product search and filtering system, allowing users to easily find and explore a wide range of products across various categories. The platform is built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js), providing a robust and scalable solution for managing product data, user authentication, and secure transactions.

* Express.js: A web application framework for Node.js, used to build the API and manage routes.
* MongoDB: A NoSQL database used to store application data such as user information, product details, and transaction records.
* dotenv: A module to load environment variables from a `.env` file, ensuring secure management of sensitive data like database credentials.
* CORS: Middleware to enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing, allowing the frontend to communicate with the backend from different origins.
